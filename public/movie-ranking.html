<h3>Eight Below</h3>
<p>I like this film because the story is inspired from a real one, the main character is Paul Walker and because it has a lot of dogs.</p>

<h3>Avatar 2</h3>
<p>The best fiction movie I've ever seen</p>

<h3>John Wick</h3>
<p>Every movie with John Wick is sick and that's the reason I can't chose one</p>
